# Test Files

This is a small repository of various files you can use for testing various things.

I don't know about you, but I always end up needing test files for projects and I always
used throw-away files, it is about time I had a more consistent approach and a repository
of files to save time in the future.

# Add your own

You can add your own files to this list by forking the project, including a well named
sample file and adding a reference file to this README file.

# Dropbox

The files can also be reached with a [shared dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hu3qxnmbggv5t5k/AABVgwH_mIcUNfp_RXvhUPZea?dl=0) if you prefer that.
